    <h2>About Mack Richardson</h2>
    <h3>The Code-Wielding, Pixel-Pushing, History-Binging Mac Maestro</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a <em>FileMaker virtuoso</em>, wrangling JSON and APIs like a symphony conductor with a keyboard.
        Whether I'm optimizing script triggers, fine-tuning layouts, or bending Astro to my will,
        I don't just solve problems — I engineer elegant workarounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I blend <em>a designer's eye</em> with <em>a developer's mind</em>, effortlessly shifting between
        CSS animations and Astro pagination like it's second nature. I've even tamed Certbot and SSL
        configs on my Mac Mini like a digital frontiersman.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's not all tech — I've got <em>soul</em>. I binge <strong>Star Trek</strong>, ponder the
        divine in <strong>Battlestar Galactica</strong>, and dive deep into <strong>Napoleonic epics</strong>.
        Stubby, my trusty dog, is always by my side, and my wife Lara shares my passion for vintage
        comics and sci-fi treasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I'm a <em>multi-core creative-meets-technical powerhouse</em> who thrives at the intersection
        of automation, aesthetics, and the delightfully detailed realms of fictional and historical rabbit holes.
